## A collection of functions to cache potentially time-consuming
## computations and a function to demostrate how the caching functions
## are used. The example function will assigned to the variable cacheSolve and
## will return the inverse of a matrix

## A fucntion to cache the mean of a vector. There two steps
## 1. if the mean has calculated then it stored.  Return the stored value
## 2. if the mean has not been calculated then calculate the mean.  Retrurn the stored value 
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {


## An exmple function show how to the makeCacheMatrix function.
## It will accept a matrix and return the inverse of a matrix. 
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
